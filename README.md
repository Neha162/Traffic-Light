# Traffic-Light
This project simulates the behavior of a traffic light with three states (red, yellow, green) cycling in a loop, similar to real-world traffic lights. The program can be enhanced to show the traffic light on a graphical interface or control actual hardware using Python libraries like Tkinter or GPIO (if you are working with Raspberry Pi).
